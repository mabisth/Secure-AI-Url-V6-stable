The previous AI engineer successfully brought the SecureURL AI application to a functional state, addressing numerous critical issues. The primary challenge revolved around persistent JSX compilation errors in , necessitating multiple iterations of structural fixes, including a complete rewrite, often requiring  consultation. Once the application compiled and rendered correctly, the focus shifted to refining the UI's display of backend analysis data. This involved extensive data mapping and rendering adjustments in the frontend to ensure all security analysis components—such as SSL/TLS, AI models, e-skimming, content, technical details, and email security—presented comprehensive and accurate information, directly reflecting the backend's rich output. The engineer diligently inspected backend data to inform frontend display logic. The trajectory ends mid-way through enhancing the verbosity of the E-Skimming section, indicating an ongoing refinement of the data presentation layer.

The SecureURL AI platform is designed to identify and analyze malicious URLs, providing comprehensive protection. Initially, it offered core URL scanning for phishing and malware. It evolved to integrate advanced ML models (deep learning, ensemble learning, OCR for screenshots), bulk scanning, and analytics. A critical feature is e-skimming protection for financial institutions, ensuring regulatory compliance. The platform provides detailed security analysis, including multi-source blacklist checks, in-depth SSL certificate validation (with vulnerability checks), security header analysis, and SPF/DMARC/DKIM email security verification, consolidated into a detailed report. Recent additions include DNS & Availability checking (online status, blocklist) and a Company Management system for registering companies and tracking scan history. An authentication system with a superuser ohm (password Namah1!!Sivaya) controls access to advanced features, making single URL scanning the default public view. The goal is to provide maximum, accurate, and evidence-based security information.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in refining the frontend display to ensure that all detailed security analysis components accurately and comprehensively reflected the data provided by the backend. This was in response to explicit user feedback that certain sections (SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis, AI Model Analysis, E-Skimming Detection Evidence, Content Analysis, Technical Details, and Email Security Records) were either showing N/A, incomplete information, or insufficient detail.

The work involved:
1.  **Backend Data Validation**: Confirming through  and direct API response inspection that the backend () was indeed generating the comprehensive data.
2.  **Frontend Data Mapping Fixes**: Making iterative modifications to  to correctly parse and display the complex objects and arrays returned by the backend. This included:
    *   Ensuring SSL certificate details (validity, issuer, expiration, protocol version, vulnerabilities) are rendered.
    *   Displaying actual predictions from AI models (phishing, malware, e-skimming).
    *   Populating Content Analysis with keywords and indicators.
    *   Ensuring Technical Details show server, location, and technology information.
    *   Correctly rendering Email Security Records (SPF/DMARC/DKIM status and scores).
    *   Specifically, the very last action in the trajectory was initiated to further **enhance the E-Skimming Detection Evidence display to be more verbose**, indicating this is the immediate task being addressed.

<optional_next_step>
Continue enhancing the E-Skimming Detection Evidence display to be more verbose, as requested by the user.
